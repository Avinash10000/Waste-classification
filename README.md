# WASTE CLASSIFICATION
This repository contains code to classify waste into organic or recyclable

I used a Deep Learning Keras model with 6 Convolutional Layers and 2 Dense Layers to achieve a 91% test accuracy
use_model function can be used to predict on new data.

## DATASET

I scrapped the web for images on oraganic and recyclable items

I trained the model with 22564 images of which 12565 images were of oraganic items and 9999 images were of recyclable items.
For the test set I had 1401 images for oragnic items and 1112 images of recyclable items making a total of 2513 items.

## DEPENDENCIES

1. Keras
2. Tensorflow
3. open-cv
4. PIL
5. matplotlib
